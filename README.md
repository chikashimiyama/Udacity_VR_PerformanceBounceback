#Udacity VR Performance Bounceback 

by Chikashi Miyama

 
-   time spent for the project : 2 days

-   the point I liked: profiler

-   challenging point: buffer pool. I do understand the problems of instantiation but if I cache even 1000 balls, it can easily reach 1000 counts. the ball has to be destroyed/disabled if it reaches the boundary for example.
